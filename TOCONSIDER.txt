- For now, a message from a sender(S) to a receiver(R)
  is in one DB table(`messages`). As a result, when one of
  S or R deletes a message, the message gets deleted for
  another one too.
  ********************************************************
  Do we want a design that sent messages are separated
  from received messages?
